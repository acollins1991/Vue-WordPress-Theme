Vue WordPress Theme
===

Hello!

My intention with this project is to integrate Vue.js as much as possible with WordPress. Not a 'headless CMS architecture' but using WordPress to ouput valid Vue.js markup that can be used to render the frontend with JS.

This project uses the Underscores base theme and WPGulp for compiling assets.

In order to use gulp the wpgulp.config.js will need to be edited as necessary.
